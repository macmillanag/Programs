This is my programs for lab 12. I was unable to get number 5 working as it was giving an error. I have uploaded a screenshot
of the error to Brightspace along with the photos of the other completed programs. 

I think all of these programs will be useful in my work placement with Galaxia Mission Systems, as we will be doing feature 
and item recognition programs for a future satellite. I have plans to practice these on my own time through out my work placement
as well for personal interests.
